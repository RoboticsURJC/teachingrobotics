# RoboticsAcademy: Learn Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision 


JdeRobot Academy is an **open source** collection of exercises to learn robotics in a practical way. Gazebo simulator is the main tool required, as ROS. Its latest documentation (including installation recipes, current available exercises and illustrative videos) is on its <a href="https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy">webpage</a>.

If you are a contributor, please note that we use GitHub Pages and a Jekyll theme (MinimalMistakes) for Academy web page. Feel free to install Jekyll locally, so that, you can test your changes before submitting your pull-request.

## For developers

To include a new exercise, add the folder with the exercise contents in exercises/static/exercises following the file name conventions. Then, create the entry in db.sqlite3. A simple way to do this is by using the Django admin page:
1)  Run ```python3.8 manage.py runserver```.
2)  Access http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ on a browser and log in with "user" and "pass".
3)  Click on "add exercise" and fill the fields: exercise id (folder name), name (name to display), state, language and description (description to display). Save and exit.
4)  Commit db.sqlite3 changes.
